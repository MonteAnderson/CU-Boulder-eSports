"Individual Media" is media that I have created on my own for club related activities. 
  - The "Other" folder contains profile pictures for players, icons, etc.
  - The "Club and Events" folder contains posters, event media for the club, etc.
  - The "University Games" folder contains media that we've used for matches against other universities.
  
"Live Events" are photos of some of the events we have held.
"Logos" is a folder that contains the logos for games/companies, background images, etc, that are free to use.
